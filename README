RUBBLE
------

How much dirty stuff do i have to mash togheter to get something awesome? How about i try with a Rumblepad, RasPI, and JACK audio.

This is a personal C++ project and a piece of media art. As a piece of interactive software meant for performance this could be considered a musical/visual instrument. I'll possibly be using this as a showcase piece in job interviews due to the diversity of functionality and several layers of abstraction handeld.

Building
--------

	make all

Running
-------

First start the JACK server:

	jackd -d alsa

Then start the main program, currently beat.out

	./beat.out

Now the JACK ports have to be connected to the system output sound. You can do this with the graphical tool QJackCtl. Now sound should be playing!
