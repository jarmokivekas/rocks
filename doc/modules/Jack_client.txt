The Jack_client object is responsible for the client-server communications with the jackd process.

Construction starts a new client.
Adding beats does exactly that, adds beat channels to the client, these have to be connected with jack_ctl or QjackCtl.
Activate starts the playback of the defined channels.
Destruction closes the client.
