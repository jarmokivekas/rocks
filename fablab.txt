What is FabLab for me?
----------------------

During a year and a half i've visited the FabLab semi-regularry working on whatever project that i have right then. My projects include an input device for the blind, graffitti printing driver electronics, a proof-of-concept 3D manufacturing process, experimental sound electronics and wheels for a robot.

I study Computer Science at the university of helsinki and for me FabLab represents a place to apply myself, share knowlege, and learn from others. FabLab offers a great selection of tools and social contacts that enable me to explore areas of interest otherwise unavailable for me. Many of my projects would not have been possible for me if it weren't for the helpful community and well kept lab.

Music projects that are on the borderlands of electronic and analog music always have obstacles due to the diversity of knowledge that is required. It's hard for one person to have an ecpressive idea, know how to code it, build the physical interface, choose the platform and design the electronics needed. This is when the openness of FabLab comes in handy. There are always people (staff an visitors) available that have insights, experience, and knowledge of something specific and that are eager to help. Turns out a lot of different people visit FabLab, including engineers, designers, artists and everything in between, so the available peer support is also very diverse.

In helsinki there is no  open space like FabLab currently. The Centrum library won't be done before 2017 and even then it will it won't have such a big variety and quality of tools as FabLab. Helsinki hacklab is lacking in the openness and due to the organisational style (there is no staff) it can't offer an environment that is easily approachable. The Hacklab is also much more technically oriented and doesn't have a comaprable creative environment.

I'd like to thank the FabLab staff for the open tuesdays, especially Charlie and Ali, they are the coolest.
